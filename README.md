# RestClient Bing Search

This very basic simple program uses the RestClient Gem to make a Bing search.

It asks the user to enter a search query, then interpolates that input into the Bing search url, and passes that to RestClient's get method. It breaks down the response into headers, cookies, status code and body.

## Why?

As an introduction to making http requests outside of the browser. It's a warmup project from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/let-s-get-building).
